# Odin Recipes
## Project Overview
Welcome to Odin Recipes, the first project in the Foundation Series for The Odin Project. This project aims to help you get started with basic HTML structure and web development principles by creating a simple recipe website.
## Project Structure
The project consists of a main page that links to individual recipe pages. Each recipe page provides details on the ingredients and instructions for preparing the dish.
### Files Included
1. index.html: The main page of the website that lists links to individual recipes.
2. chicken_club_pasta_salad.html: A recipe page for Chicken Club Pasta Salad.
3. rotisserie_chicken.html: A recipe page for Rotisserie Chicken.
4. white_chocolate_raspberry_cheesecake.html: A recipe page for White Chocolate Respberry Cheesecake.
## Getting Started
To view the website locally, open `index.html` in your preferred web browser. This will display the main page with links to the recipes.
### Directory Structure
The project directory is organized as follows:
`
/Odin_Recipes
|- index.html
|- recipes
|  |- chicken_club_pasta_salad.html
|  |- rotisserie_chicken.html
